# tikz-3dtools
Experimental library for 3d operations with TikZ.

This library may be used and distributed under the [LPPL License for LaTeX v1.3c](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/lppl-1-3c/).

Note that an earlier version of the library appeared on CTAN. I did neither submit the library, nor did I authorize the submission. 
CTAN kindly acknowledged that something went wrong when they did not check whether the submission was authorized. So this is to say that I feel sorry for those who find wrong libraries or dead links in the internet. If you find any links beyond CTAN, please ask the host to remove them and/or report them here. 

This is also to let you know that I am no longer actively developing the library. I may still fix bugs, though. But please do not believe some statements some may make in some chats without independently confirming them. These chats are like social media, and get abused in a similar fashion. Like in social media, try to fact-check statements. The abuse that happens in these chats did already more than enough harm.
