# tikz-3dtools
Experimental library for 3d operations with TikZ.
Note that an earlier version of the library appeared on CTAN. I did neither submit the library, nor did I authorize the submission. 
CTAN kindly acknowledged that something went wrong when they did not check whether the submission was authorized. So this is to say that I feel sorry for those who find wrong libraries or dead links in the internet. However, I do not feel responsible as I only learned about the submission when updating my TeXLive installation. Of course I removed the submission (even though I think this should have been done by the submitter) but one continues to find dead links. 
I do not know what to say about https://github.com/hmenke/tikz-3dtools except that I did NOT authorize or otherwise approve this. 
This seems to be an interesting era in the internet. In order to understand the licenses one seems to need a law degree. I do not have a law degree. All I want is to share the library with those who want to try it out and/or use it. However, I hope that this does not get interpreted as the permission to upload it to CTAN, say.
