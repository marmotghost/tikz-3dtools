# tikz-3dtools
Experimental library for 3d operations with TikZ.

This library may be used and distributed under the [LPPL License for LaTeX v1.3c](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/lppl-1-3c/).

Note that an earlier version of the library appeared on CTAN. I did neither submit the library, nor did I authorize the submission. 
CTAN kindly acknowledged that something went wrong when they did not check whether the submission was authorized. So this is to say that I feel sorry for those who find wrong libraries or dead links in the internet. However, I do not feel responsible as I only learned about the submission when updating my TeXLive installation. Of course I removed the submission (even though I think this should have been done by the submitter) but one continues to find dead links. 
I do not know what to say about https://github.com/hmenke/tikz-3dtools except that I did NOT authorize or otherwise approve this. I asked both contributors that it be removed.
